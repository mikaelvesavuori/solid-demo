# SOLID demonstration using TypeScript

In the SILOD ("siloed") order:

0. Start
1. `SRP`: Begin to break up functionality and make it semantic and clean.
2. `ISP`: Look at email service + interface in `base.ts`
3. `LSP`: TODO
4. `OCP`: TODO
5. `DIP`: TODO

## Running the code

You can install the things with `npm install`. For running the starting code, run `npm start`. Then, for each respective letter of the SOLID principles you want to run, use `npm run s|o|l|i|d`.

Or, if you're lazy, you can also copy the individual TS file's contents into the [TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) if you want to avoid cloning and installing anything at all.
